Hello everyone, my name is Harrison Haas and welcome to my GitHub Page. I am a Statistics Major and Computer Science Minor at the University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire in the spring semester of my freshman year. I enjoy watching sports and hanging out with friends and family in my free time. I am a student manager on the UW–EC Baseball team and love to watch other sports teams at the university as well, especially the football and men’s hockey teams. Go Blugolds!
