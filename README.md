## About Me
Hello everyone, My name is Harrison Haas and welcome to my GitHub Page. I am a Statistics Major, Computer Science Minor at the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire in the spring semester of my freshman year. I enjoy watching sports and hanging out with friends and family in my free time. I am a student manager on the UW-EC Baseball team and love to watch other sports teams of the university as well, especially the football and men's hockey teams. Go Blugolds
